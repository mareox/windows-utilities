# AGENTS.md — windows-utilities

Canonical agent contract. `CLAUDE.md` is an adapter whose first line is `@AGENTS.md`.

## Purpose

Windows-specific scripts and utilities.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd windows-utilities && ls              # survey the scripts before running anything
bash <script>.sh --help      # most scripts are self-documenting
```

Read the repo README.md for tool-specific usage. Run scripts only after
reviewing them; most target homelab infrastructure or personal machines.

## Operating rules

- Python tooling runs via `uv run` from the project directory (workspace standard).
- Scripts are executed on mbp4x/atlas or deployed to servers per
  `homelab-infra/AGENTS.md` deployment workflow; never edit remote files in place.
- Infrastructure facts (IPs, hostnames, inventory) live in
  `homelab-infra/INFRASTRUCTURE.md`; service history lives in the
  `homelab-wiki/_meta/service-catalog/`.

## Golden Rules

Working contract: [Golden Rules](../_c-docs/GOLDEN-RULES.md) (workspace-relative).
